Solved 3/5 hardware challenges. ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ

# Challenge 1: An4lyz3_1t [WARM-UP]
50 points, 140 solves 

## 📁 Challenge Description
>Our surveillance team has managed to tap into a secret serial communication and capture a digital signal using a Saleae logic analyzer. Your objective is to decode the signal and uncover the hidden message.

## 🚩 Solution

We have been given a `chall.sal` file. After acknowledging that there are no easy wins in the file, head your way and download the [Saleae logic analyzer](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) (if you haven't yet) as the description says.

After importing the challenge file, we observed that only **D4** channel contains information. At first, I was so traumatized that I thought it was some binary challenges (`'0's`, `'1's`). However, it seems like it is not the case.

The tool has a built-in analyzer. Choose **Async Serial** analyzer where **D4** should be selected as the input channel. By doing some trials and errors, the bit rate is the deciding factor as different bit rates return different results where the correct flag data has also been returned. Set the bit rate to around `57600` bits/s and the others remain the same settings.

The image below indicates this characteristic where *red* and *blue* are bit rates `57600` bits/s and `115200` bits/s respectively. In definition, higher bit rates give more accurate data. However, it still depends on the dataset.

In the **Data** section, you can retrieve the flag by switching to Terminal mode. We may see many flags have been returned due to the flag signal appearing multiple times in the same channel.

# Challenge 3: picopico
200 points, 55 solves

## 📁 Challenge Description
>Security personnel in our company have spotted a suspicious USB flash drive. They found a Raspberry Pi Pico board inside the case, but no flash drive board. Here's the firmware dump of the Raspberry Pi Pico board. Could you figure out what this 'USB flash drive' is for?
