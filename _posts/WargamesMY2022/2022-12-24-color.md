Basic QR Code Challenge based on RGB Color Model.

## Challenge Description
> Please message us on discord if you are colorblind (Because Iâ€™m easy come, easy go, Little high, little low,)

## Solution
We get a QR code with multiple colors. The solution for this challenge is that the colored QR code contains more than one valid QR codes.
Hence, I utilize stegsolve to filter out valid QR codes and scan each of the QR code separately.
