## Let's GO!

Let us start with a quick intro regarding the flow of the event. In this event, two separate rounds were involved which are the **qualification round** and the **final round**. 

#### Qualification Round 

It is a 7-hour Jeopardy-Style Capture-the-Flag (CTF) baseline which started at 10 a.m. and ended at 5 p.m. on 10th December 2022, held online where each team need to compete the top 20 by solving a variety of challenges in order to proceed to the final round. 

#### Final Round 

It is another 24-hour CTF competition based on Attack & Defense Style, and it was held on the 19th & 20th December 2022 at [Ministry of Defense (MinDef)](https://mod.gov.my/en/), features a diverse set of mixed challenges from various security categories such as forensics, web exploitation, offensive and defensive strategies with the number of points awarded for submitting a valid flag varying according to the challenge difficulty. Players who proceed to the finals need to head to the stated location to compete physically. 

## Obliterate the Quals

As more and more online CTF competitions were joined by us over the past 2 years, we have enough experiences to secure the top 20 easily. However, only 2-3 teams in the same university are able to join the finals according to the rules which creates an additional challenge for us. Due to our ambition and determination, we basically give our all out and we are lucky enough to be the 2nd team which represented APU to compete the next round.
